## Introduction

A space is simply a set of objects. In a reinforcement learning context, spaces define the sets of possible states, actions, and observations.

In Julia, spaces can be represented by a variety of objects. For instance, a small discrete action set might be represented with `["up", "left", "down", "right"]`, or an interval of real numbers might be represented with an object from the [`IntervalSets`](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IntervalSets.jl) package. In general, the space defined by any Julia object is the set of objects `x` for which `x in space` returns `true`.

In addition to establishing the definition above, this package provides three useful tools:

1. Traits to communicate about the properties of spaces, e.g. whether they are continuous or discrete, how many subspaces they have, and how to interact with them.
2. Functions such as `product` for constructing more complex spaces
3. Constructors to for spaces whose elements are arrays, such as `ArraySpace` and `Box`.

## Concepts and Interface

### Interface for all spaces

Since a space is simply a set of objects, a wide variety of common Julia types including `Vector`, `Set`, `Tuple`, and `Dict`<sup>1</sup>can represent a space.
Because of this inclusive definition, there is a very minimal interface that all spaces are expected to implement. Specifically, it consists of 
- `in(x, space)`, which tests whether `x` is a member of the set `space` (this can also be called with the `x in space` syntax).
- `rand(space)`, which returns a valid member of the set<sup>2</sup>.
- `eltype(space)`, which returns the type of the elements in the space.

In addition, the `SpaceStyle` trait is always defined. Calling `SpaceStyle(space)` will return either a `FiniteSpaceStyle`, `ContinuousSpaceStyle`, `HybridSpaceStyle`, or an `UnknownSpaceStyle` object.

### Finite discrete spaces

Spaces with a finite number of elements have `FiniteSpaceStyle`. These spaces are guaranteed to be iterable, implementing Julia's [iteration interface](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/interfaces/). In particular `collect(space)` will return all elements in an array.

### Continuous spaces

Continuous spaces represent sets that have an uncountable number of elements they have a `SpaceStyle` of type `ContinuousSpaceStyle`. CommonRLSpaces does not adopt a rigorous mathematical definition of a continuous set, but, roughly, elements in the interior of a continuous space have other elements very close to them.

Continuous spaces have some additional interface functions:

- `bounds(space)` returns upper and lower bounds in a tuple. For example, if `space` is a unit circle, `bounds(space)` will return `([-1.0, -1.0], [1.0, 1.0])`. This allows agents to choose policies that appropriately cover the space e.g. a normal distribution with a mean of `mean(bounds(space))` and a standard deviation of half the distance between the bounds.
- `clamp(x, space)` returns an element of `space` that is near `x`. i.e. if `space` is a unit circle, `clamp([2.0, 0.0], space)` might return `[1.0, 0.0]`. This allows for a convenient way for an agent to find a valid action if they sample actions from a distribution that doesn't match the space exactly (e.g. a normal distribution).
- [Not implemented] `clamp!(x, space)`, similar to `clamp`, but clamps `x` in place.

### Hybrid spaces

The interface for hybrid continuous-discrete spaces is currently planned, but not yet defined. If the space style is not `FiniteSpaceStyle` or `ContinuousSpaceStyle`, it is `UnknownSpaceStyle`.

### Spaces of arrays

[need to figure this out, but I think `elsize(space)` should return the size of the arrays in the space]

### Cartesian products of spaces

The Cartesian product of two spaces `a` and `b` can be constructed with `c = product(a, b)`.

The exact form of the resulting space is unspecified and should be considered an implementation detail. The only guarantees are (1) that there will be one unique element of `c` for every combination of one object from `a` and one object from `b` and (2) that the resulting space conforms to the interface above.

The `TupleSpaceProduct` constructor provides a specialized Cartesian product where each element is a tuple, i.e. `TupleSpaceProduct(a, b)` has elements of type `Tuple{eltype(a), eltype(b)}`.

---

<sup>1</sup>Note: the elements of a space represented by a `Dict` are key-value `Pair`s.
<sup>2</sup>[TODO: should we make any guarantees about whether `rand(space)` is drawn from a uniform distribution?]
